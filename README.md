*Note: Don't mind the gaps in the box, it differs with the terminal font.*

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/consoletree/hexie
cd hexie/
chmod +x hexie
sudo mv hexie /usr/bin/
```
## Usage

Enter the hex color code as an argument with hexie.
 
`hexie "#ffff00"`

**Note: Be sure to add the hex code inside "# ", else you will be greeted with an ugly error!**
